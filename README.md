# CODEQUALITY-LARAVEL

This is my personal codequality setup, it will differ from a couple of standards, but that's what we have linters in
CI/CD for, right? ;) -- I keed I keed, if I ever run into a project that is set on standards, I'll just update my configurations
or will make a hook with grumphp to auto-format into those other standards.

For grumphp to work you'll need to `composer require --dev phpro/grumphp-shim`, if that fails for some reason do `composer require --dev phpro/grumphp`
