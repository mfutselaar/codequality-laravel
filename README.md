# CODEQUALITY-LARAVEL

This is my personal codequality setup, it will differ from a couple of standards, but that's what we have linters in
CI/CD for, right?

For grumphp to work you'll need to `composer require --dev phpro/grumphp-shim`, if that fails for some reason do `composer require --dev phpro/grumphp`
